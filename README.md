# Unity-beyond-the-basics-project-files
This is the unity project files for the game a need help with.
The game is supposed to work; the UI should work and the objects in the game should be interacting with each other but none of that is happening in the game even though I followed the code step by step on the beyond the basics course on Unity learn (I am new to game dev and would appreciate it if someone could please help me in debugging it ðŸ™‚. I am also a student developer and would like to learn from what I did wrong).
Thank you in advance.
